The inverse distance weighting (IDW) weights the known points in a search area around the unknown point using distance . The search area may be a circle, a square or any other shape.

In addition to the indirect method described above, direct geo- referencing can also be conducted in some cases. For example, a TLS can be centred over a known point and levelled as if it were a total station. The position can also be determinedusing a GNSS antenna mounted onusing a GNSS antenna mounted on top of a TLS.', metadata={'source': 'Docs\\\\Paper_Lemmens_2014.pdf'}),\n",

The integration of the raw data is largely automated and results in a geo-referenced 3D point cloud which often needs editing to remove outliers and other improper points. Usually the point cloud is transferred to a 2.5D surface in the form of regular grids or triangulated irregular networks (TIN). These products often act as the basis for input in CAD, B IM and other software tools used by planners, designers, inspectors and others.', metadata={'source': 'Docs\\\\Paper_Lemmens_2014.pdf'}),\n",
